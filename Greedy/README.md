# Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms are used to solve optimization problems. They make a sequence of choices that are locally optimal at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. Greedy algorithms are often used to solve problems where making a locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution.
